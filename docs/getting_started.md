# Getting started

## Project setup

Running Sosse in an empty project the first time will automatically create a small example `main.js` file which can be used as a starting point.

```bash
# Start by creating a folder for your new app
mkdir sosse-app;
cd sosse-app;
npm init -y;

# Install and run sosse
npm install sosse@next;
npx sosse start
```

## Folder structure
